# Hugging Face AI Model Security Tooling

I am a software engineer who is currently focused on the vulnerabilities and mitigations of systems with AI components, particularly LLMs. 

In this repo I toy around with AI security tools, and integrating them into CI/CD pipelines and other developer workflows.

This is a new-ish repo I'm currently getting set up with a sample chat application. I'll update with more details once more structure is in place.
